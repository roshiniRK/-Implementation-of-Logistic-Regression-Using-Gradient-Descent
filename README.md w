# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the packages required.
2.Read the dataset. 
3.Define X and Y array.
4.Define a function for costFunction,cost and gradient.
5.Define a function to plot the decision boundary and predict the Regression value.

## Program:
```
/*

Developed by: 
RegisterNumber:  
*/
```

## Output:
![logistic regression using gradient descent](sam.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent is written and verified using python programming.
